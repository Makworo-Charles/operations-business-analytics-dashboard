# Analysis Notes & Key Findings

## Analytical Approach
The analysis focused on evaluating SLA performance, identifying operational bottlenecks, and assessing cost efficiency. Pareto analysis principles were applied to prioritize high-impact problem areas.

## Key Findings
- SLA compliance averages approximately 45%, with visible declines during high-volume months.
- A small number of issue categories account for the majority of SLA breaches.
- High-priority tickets drive disproportionate operational costs.
- Certain departments consistently show longer resolution times, suggesting capacity or process constraints.

## Business Implications
- Improving performance in the top SLA-breaching issue categories would yield the highest operational impact.
- Better workload distribution during peak periods could improve SLA compliance.
- Cost control initiatives should focus on high-priority, high-cost ticket types.

## Next Steps
- Introduce staffing or automation interventions for high-volume issue categories.
- Track SLA performance monthly to assess improvement initiatives.
- Expand analysis to include agent-level productivity metrics.
